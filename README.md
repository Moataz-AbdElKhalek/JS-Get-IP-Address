# JS-Get-IP-Address

### 1. Local IP Address:
- To get the Local IP Address of the client, just open the mad.html in the browser..
- I made this code compatible with Firefox and Chrome


### 2. Public IP Address:
- To get the puclic IP address, you should use a web service that can return JSON (along with jQuery to make things simpler).
  - Below is a sample of free active IP lookup services:
